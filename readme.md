# How do I reinstall my packages for R 4.0 when many of them came from Github?

Many online resources ([example](https://rstats.wtf/maintaining-r.html#how-to-transfer-your-library-when-updating-r)) describe how to save metadata from your package library to batch-reinstall packages from CRAN. But we often get packages from other sources (including Github). How do we augment the workflow to accommodate these other package sources? 

This repository contains code for my (Mike DeCrescenzo's) method. For more see this [blog post](https://mikedecr.github.io/post/package-reinstall/).
